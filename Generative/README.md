This is the section for Generative models. 
In DCGAN I generate the MNIST handwritten digit dataset with a poor-man's implementation of Vector-Quantization(concatenating actual input features to the latent space vector.) This is in the hopes that I can tell it what digit I would like to generate. Here is a GIF of what has been done.

In Neural Style Transfer I blend my current profile picture with the style of one of my favorite artists: El Huervo. Here is a gif of that:
